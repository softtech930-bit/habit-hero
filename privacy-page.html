    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: November 21, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>SoftTech ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is collected, used, and disclosed by <strong>HabitHero</strong> (the "App").</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p><strong>HabitHero is an offline-first application.</strong> We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal data on our servers. All data you enter into the App (such as habits, completion history, and achievements) is stored locally on your device using the Hive database technology.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All user data is stored locally on your device. If you uninstall the App or clear the App's data, your habits and progress will be permanently deleted unless you have performed your own manual backups (if supported by your device's operating system).</p>

    <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The App may request the following permissions to function correctly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Used to send you reminders for your habits. These notifications are scheduled locally on your device and are not sent from a remote server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not use third-party analytics, advertising services, or tracking tools that collect personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect personal information, our App is safe for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
